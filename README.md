## 4th

Let’s say we want to print numbers from 0 - 4 we can use for loop to print all of them! But we want them to print with a delay of `n` seconds where `n` is the current iteration for example in 1st iteration the delay is 0 seconds and in 2nd it’s 1 seconds and in 3rd it’s 2 seconds and so on..
The following code doesn’t seem to work as expected, please find the bug and help fix it with a brief explanation

```for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
